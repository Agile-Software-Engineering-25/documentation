# Website

You can find a deployment of this Documentation website under [https://agile-software-engineering-25.github.io/documentation/](https://agile-software-engineering-25.github.io/documentation/)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment
