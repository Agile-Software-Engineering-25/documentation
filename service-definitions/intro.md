# Service Overview & Integration Requirements

Welcome to the **Service Advertising & Integration Page** of our software project!

As our project scales to include over 15 individual services developed by different teams, it's essential to maintain clarity around what each service **provides** and **requires**. This section is designed to serve exactly that purpose.

Each team should create a dedicated page for their service using the provided template. Your service page should describe:
- ✅ What **information** your service exposes to others (i.e. API endpoints or data formats).
- 📥 What **information** your service requires from other services.
- 🧑‍💻 Who to **contact** for integration questions or debugging.
- 🧪 Example payloads and response formats, if available.

## Goals of this Section
- Promote **communication** and **collaboration** between teams.
- Prevent redundant work by making service capabilities transparent.
- Enable easier **integration** and **testing** across service boundaries.
- Serve as living documentation during the entire lifecycle of the project.

## Contribution Guide
To add your service:
1. Copy the [service template](service-template.md) into your service folder.
2. Fill in the details specific to your service.
3. Add a link to your service page in the sidebar (if not automated).
4. Keep your page updated as your service evolves.

This section will grow as more teams add their services—help us make it a powerful tool for teamwork and success!
