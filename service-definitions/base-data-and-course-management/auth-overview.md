# Area F3 Overview
**User & Course Master Data, Group & Role Management and Authentication**

This document provides an overview of the authentication process within this project.  
It also explains how to secure your endpoints, outlines the concepts of group and role management, and describes how to retrieve user data, user and course master data.

## TL;DR
- **User creation**: Managed by multiple F3 teams.  
  - Team‚Äë10: account creation  
  - Team‚Äë8: group assignment  
  - Team‚Äë11: user master data  
  Users cannot self‚Äëregister. **HVS‚ÄëAdmins** create accounts for *Hochschulverwaltungsmitarbeiter*, who in turn are authorized to create accounts for **Student** and **Dozent**. Account creation can be done individually or in bulk via CSV.  
- **Login**: Centralized via Keycloak using OAuth2 Code Flow with PKCE. Access JWTs are auto‚Äëattached to requests via Axios, validated in the backend, and checked against roles.  
- **Roles & groups**: Roles follow the naming scheme `[Area].[Team].[Read|Write].[Module]` and are inherited via groups. Services must check roles before granting access.  
- **User information**: Team‚Äë10 provides interfaces to retrieve user ID, first name, last name, email, and roles. Spring Boot projects can use the GitHub template; other stacks must implement JWT validation/claims parsing themselves.  
- **Additional APIs**:  
  - Team‚Äë10: account info (single user by ID, full user list)  
  - Team‚Äë8: group memberships by user ID  
  - Team‚Äë11: user master data (fields vary by user group, filtering/search supported)  
  - Team‚Äë9: course master data (study programs, modules, courses, mappings)  
- **User deletion**: Coordinated by Team‚Äë10. A deletion event is published to the **central message broker** (Team‚Äë12). Dependent services (e.g., Team‚Äë11 for master data) must subscribe and clean up related data.

## User creation process
The user creation process is managed by different F3 teams (please also take a look at the [visualisation](auth-overview#distribution-of-concerns-in-area-f3-diagram)), each responsible for a specific part:
- **User account creation** - handled by *Team-10 "HAriBO"*
  - **Contact person:** Luca Schmitz
  - **Consumes:**
    - First name & last name
    - E-mail address
- **Group assignment** - handled by *Team-10 "HAriBO"*
  - **Contact person:** Luca Schmitz
  - Groups can be *HVS-Admin*, *Hochschulverwaltungsmitarbeiter*, *Dozent*, *Student*, or custom groups that inherit permissions from one of these base groups.
  - **Consumes:**  
    - Selected group to assign to the user
- **Collection of user master data** - handled by *Team-11*
  - **Contact person:** Carlo Bockermann
  - **Consumes:**
    - General user-related data  
    - Additional data required based on the assigned group

Note that users are not allowed to register themselves. Instead, the **HVS-Admin** can create accounts for **Hochschulverwaltungsmitarbeiter**, who in turn are authorized to create new accounts for **Student** and **Dozent**.  
Account creation can be performed either individually or in bulk using a CSV file.

## Login process
- **Commissioned:** Team-10 "HAriBO"
- **Contact person:** Luca Schmitz

When the frontend is opened, it first checks whether a valid token is already available.
- If so, the user is considered logged in.
- If not, the application will attempt a silent login in the background (e.g. via iFrame). This only succeeds if there is still an active session (valid token) with Keycloak.
- If the silent login also fails, the user is redirected to the Keycloak login page.

After successful authentication in Keycloak, the user is redirected back to the application and is now logged in (from the user's perspective this appears seamless).

In reality, a number of additional steps take place under the hood. If you are interested in the details, please refer to the [**OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE Docs**](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce).

After a successful login, the access JWT will automatically be added as a header to all requests made through Axios.  
This means you don‚Äôt have to handle authentication against your backend manually. (‚ö†Ô∏è This functionality is still **WiP**!)  

On the backend side, the JWT attached to incoming requests will be validated by the middleware/filter in the Spring Boot application (more details can be found in the next section).  
All you need to do is define which endpoints require which roles (please take a look at the [Role Creation](auth-overview#request-role-creation) section), allowing us to establish a fine‚Äëgrained access control structure.

## Request Role Creation

If your service provides specific functionality (e.g., a timetable service), you may need to define a new **role**.  
Roles represent access rights that can be assigned both to standard user groups (one or multiple of: `HVS-Admin`, `Hochschulverwaltungsmitarbeiter`, `Dozent`, `Student`) and, if necessary, to other microservices.  

Each role follows a standardized naming pattern:  
`[Area].[Team].[Read|Write].[Module]`

**Example:**  
`Area-3.Team-09.Read.Stundenplan`  

This role could be assigned to the standard group **"Student"**, ensuring that all students automatically inherit read access to timetables.  
In practice, this works as follows:  
- A student logs in and receives the corresponding roles via their group membership.  
- The **timetable frontend** checks whether the user has the role required to view <ins>a</ins> (unspecified) timetable.  
- If authorized, the frontend requests the timetable from the respective **microservice**.  
- The microservice then returns the relevant timetable data for that user based on the **user ID** contained in the validated access JWT (retrieval of this data is explained in the next chapter).

### How can I request a new role for my functionality?
We are preparing a simple form that will be published here and can be used to request the creation of new roles.  
In this form, you will be asked to provide all necessary details so that we can create the role for you.  

üëâ Please already start considering which roles your service may require and to which standard groups they should belong (one or multiple of: `HVS-Admin`, `Hochschulverwaltungsmitarbeiter`, `Dozent`, `Student`).

---

## How can I retrieve user information?
Team-10 "HAriBO" is responsible for providing access to the basic information of the currently logged-in user.  
This information includes:  
- User ID
- First name  
- Last name  
- E-mail address  
- User roles  

### Backend integration
To make this data easily accessible, standard interfaces will be provided. (‚ö†Ô∏è This functionality is still **WiP**!)  

For teams working with **Spring Boot**, this functionality will be directly integrated into the official template repository in our GitHub organization, which already serves as the foundation for many projects. The template will come with:  
- **JWT validation**  
- **Parsing of user information from the JWT**  
- **Predefined interfaces** for convenient access to user data in application code  

The template will be maintained and updated by Team-10. To adopt new features or fixes, teams only need to keep their repositories synchronized with the template by opening a merge request from the template repository as a remote. Detailed update instructions will follow.  

For teams working with **other backend technologies** (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js), the same tasks must be implemented independently. Each team is responsible for:  
- Securely validating incoming JWTs  
- Parsing and extracting user information from the tokens  
- Providing well-defined interfaces within their own applications  

### Frontend integration
Similar interfaces are also being developed in the **frontend-template** repository to enable consistent access to the same user information in the client applications.  
These interfaces are already merged into the `root-ui` and `frontend-template` repos and can be used via the **useUser-Hook**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Login is handled **only in the root-ui** repo, not in microfrontends (e.g., frontend-template). Microfrontends receive the user object from root-ui. To test frontend access to user data, start root-ui and integrate your microfrontend as shown in the frontend-template example.

`useUser` is a custom React hook that provides access to a **global user state** (OIDC user), keeps it in sync across components, and exposes helper functions like `getFullName()`, `getEmail()`, or `hasRole(role)`.

**How to use:**  
```tsx
import useUser from '@/hooks/useUser';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const user = useUser(); // get access at the top of your component

  console.log(user.getFullName()); // Full name
  console.log(user.getEmail());    // Email
  console.log(user.hasRole("admin")); // Check role
};
```

‚ö†Ô∏è As a reminder: information provided by the **frontend must never be trusted** without proper validation on the backend.  

### Planned interfaces
To give an impression of how access will look, here is a simplified overview of the planned methods. Please note that the real implementation will take the conventions of the underlying language and framework into account (e.g. React for frontend, Spring Boot for backend):  
- `getUserID() -> string`  
- `getFirstName() -> string`  
- `getLastName() -> string`  
- `getFullName() -> string`  
- `getEmail() -> string`  
- `hasRole(roleName: string) -> boolean`

## Additional data access through APIs
In addition to the user information obtained via JWT parsing (in the frontend-template and the Spring Boot microservice), the F3 teams provide further data and functionality through dedicated APIs. These APIs allow services to query information about accounts, groups, user master data, and course master data.

### Account information - Team-10 "HAriBO"
(‚ö†Ô∏è This functionality is still **WiP**!)  
Beyond the data of the currently logged-in user (user ID, first name, last name, e‚Äëmail, roles), Team‚Äë10 will provide API endpoints to:  
- Retrieve account details for a specific user by their user ID  
- Retrieve a complete list of all users  

**API definition:** [Swagger](./team10-api.md)  
**Contact person:** Luca Schmitz

### Group management - Team-8
APIs from Team‚Äë8 will provide information on:  
- Determining the group(s) a user belongs to by their user ID  

**API definition:** [Swagger](./team8-api.md)  
**Contact person:** Ole Leister

### User Master Data - Team-11
APIs from Team‚Äë11 allow access to extended user master data:  
- Retrieve detailed master data for a specific user by their user ID  
  - The type and range of fields depend on the user group.  
    *Example: Students have a specific field called `Matrikelnummer`.*  
- Search and filter for users based on field values or ranges, returning matching user IDs.  
  - These IDs could then be used to call the Team‚Äë10 API in order to fetch additional account information (e.g. names).  

**API definition:** [Swagger](./team11-api.md)  
**Contact person:** Carlo Bockermann

### Course Master Data - Team-9
Team‚Äë9 provides APIs for course-related structures:  
- Provision of study program templates (i.e. virtual Modulhandbuch for the study program) and study program instances (i.e. specific program for a student group)
- Provision of module templates and specific module instances  
- Provision of courses templates and specific course instances 
- Retrieve which modules belong to which study program(s)
- Retrieve which courses belong to a specific module

**API definition:** [Swagger](./team9-api.md)  
**Contact person:** Patricia Schiewald

## User deletion
(‚ö†Ô∏è This functionality is still **WiP**!)  
If your team requires functionality to delete a user account (for example, giving users the option to permanently remove their account for privacy reasons, or in other specific use cases), please contact **Team-10 "HAriBO"**.  
**Contact person:** Luca Schmitz  

Whenever a user deletion is performed, an event will be published to the **central message broker** (managed by Team-12).  
This event serves as a notification that a specific user account has been removed.  

If your service stores data linked to user IDs, you can subscribe to this event and handle the cleanup of related records accordingly.  

**Example:**  
Team-11 manages user master data and stores entries tied to user IDs. By subscribing to the deletion event, Team-11 can automatically remove the corresponding master data whenever a user account is deleted.
