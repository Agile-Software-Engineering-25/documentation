# Overview
The DMS service enables storing, versioning, and serving documents (upload/download, folder structure, metadata, permissions).

# Goals
- Centralized file and folder management
- Role-based access

# Dependencies
- **Team 4 - Abstract File Service**  
  - The DMS does not directly interact with the Central Database. Instead, it consumes Team 4’s API, for it
