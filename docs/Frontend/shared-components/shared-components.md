# About

shared-components is a library intended to be used by every frontend in SAU. It contains components made to be used across multiple projects and a custom common theme `joy`.

If you think a component you created might be interesting for other teams then add it to the library or before you create one yourself look through the library maybe someone already created your component.

# ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer‚ö†Ô∏è

All Components and the joy theme in this repository are **ONLY** examples and **NEED** to be exchanged with real ones. Expect them to be deleted or massively changed.

# Installation & Usage

See the [frontend-template-repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/frontend-template) and the [shared-components-repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/shared-components) for installation and usage.
