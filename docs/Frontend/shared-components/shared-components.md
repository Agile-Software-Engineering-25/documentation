# About

shared-components is a library intended for use by all SAU frontends. It contains reusable components and a custom common theme called `joy`.

If you think a component you created might be useful for other teams, add it to the library. Before creating a new component, check if someone has already created what you need.

# ⚠️Disclaimer⚠️

All Components and the joy theme in this repository are **ONLY** examples and **NEED** to be exchanged with real ones. Expect them to be deleted or massively changed.

# Installation & Usage

See the [frontend-template-repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/frontend-template) and the [shared-components-repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/shared-components) for installation and usage.

# Support
