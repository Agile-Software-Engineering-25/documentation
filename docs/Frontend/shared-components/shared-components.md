# About

shared-components is a library intended for use by all SAU frontends. It contains reusable components and a custom common theme called `joy`.

If you think a component you created might be interesting for other teams then add it to the library or before you create one yourself look through the library maybe someone already created your component.

# ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer‚ö†Ô∏è

All Components and the joy theme in this repository are **ONLY** examples and **NEED** to be exchanged with real ones. Expect them to be deleted or massively changed.
