# üöÄ Microfrontend Deployment Guide

---

Deploying your **microfrontends** is simpler than deploying backend services.  
You don‚Äôt need to deal with Rancher or Kubernetes ‚Äî all you need are your **MinIO credentials**.

üëâ Your Product Owner should have access to these credentials.  
If not, please reach out to **Janne Keipert** (üìß jabbekeipert@gmail.com).

---

## üì¶ Deployment Process

---

Your task is straightforward:  
**Upload your build artifacts to MinIO.**

We‚Äôve prepared a **MinIO server** and a **bucket** specifically for this purpose.  
Below is a ready-to-use **GitHub Actions workflow** that:

0. Configure your frontend
1. Builds your application (`npm run build`)
2. Uploads the build artifacts to your MinIO bucket

---

## üîß Configure your vite frontend 
### Base URL
Inside your vite.config.js file, you should have this line: (around line 16)

```ts
  base: command === "serve" ? "/" : BASE_URL_DEPLOYMENT
```

Here you need to define your deployment base URL, for this you can just replace the variable in the end with
`/api/ASE-[YOUR-TEAM-NUMBER]/`.

For your build to succeed, you also need to remove the variable `BASE_URL_DEPLOYMENT` from the `vite.config.ts` file. (as the typescript build is quite picky)

### External libraries:

In line 12, you should have something like this:

`const NPM_EXTERNALS: string[] = ["react", "react-dom"];`

This defines the external libraries that are not bundled into the application, at the moment we have some issues with the external libraries, so we need to add them into every build for now. 
This means you can just clear the array for now.
This should leave you with something like this:

`const NPM_EXTERNALS: string[] = [];`

In the end it should look like this:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";
import vitePluginSingleSpa from "vite-plugin-single-spa";
import vitePluginReactHMR from "vite-plugin-react-single-spa-hmr";

const PORT = parseInt(process.env.PORT ?? "5173");

const ENTRY_POINT = "src/singleSpa.tsx";

const NPM_EXTERNALS: string[] = [];

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig(({ command }) => ({
  base: command === "serve" ? "/" : "/api/ASE-12/",
  plugins: [
    react(),
    command === "serve" && vitePluginReactHMR(ENTRY_POINT),
    vitePluginSingleSpa({
      type: "mife",
      serverPort: PORT,
      spaEntryPoints: ENTRY_POINT,
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
      "@components": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/components"),
      "@pages": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/pages"),
      "@utils": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/utils"),
      "@custom-types": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/@custom-types"),
      "@hooks": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/hooks"),
      "@assets": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/assets"),
      "@stores": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/stores"),
    },
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [...NPM_EXTERNALS],
    },
  },
}));
```

## üõ† GitHub Actions Workflow

## üß™ Testing the Workflow

If you want the workflow to run for **every branch push**, update this section:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

‚¨á Change it to:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "**" ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

---

## üåê Accessing Your Deployed App

Once deployed, your artifacts will be available at:

```
https://sau-portal.de/api/[BUCKET_NAME]/singleSpa.js
```

To integrate your microfrontend into the **Root UI**, please contact:  
üìß **Janne Keipert** (jabbekeipert@gmail.com)

## üìù Notes

- ‚úÖ Deployment is **fully automated** once set up
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious everything you upload into your bucket will be **public** ‚Äî only upload non sensitive files
- üêõ If you spot any errors or issues, let me know
