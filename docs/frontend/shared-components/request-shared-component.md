# Request a new shared-component

All new shared components should be requested via our shared form.  
This ensures a consistent process across all teams and makes sure every request is tracked in one place.

## Process Overview

1. **Submit a request**  
   Fill out the request form: [‚û°Ô∏è Request Form](https://n8n.pybay.de/form/4d538dde-de36-402d-91d3-8db3da251005)  
   Please Provide:
   - Requesting Team
   - Contact Person
   - Contact Email
   - Component Name
   - Component Description
   - Link to sample (optional)

2. **Issue creation**  
   An issue is automatically created in the [shared-components GitHub repo](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/shared-components/issues).  
   The issue is also added to the shared Kanban board: [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/projects/4/views/1)  

3. **Design team review**  
   The design team first reviews the request to ensure visual and UX consistency.  
   They may update the issue with design guidelines or mockups.

4. **Implementation**  
   Once the design is approved, the requester (your team) is expected to implement the component in the [`shared-components` library](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/shared-components).  
   - Follow the [development guide](./developing.md) to set up your local environment.  
   - Open a Pull Request linking the issue.  

5. **Tracking & updates**  
   The Kanban board is managed by **Alexander Jablonowski**.  
   You can always check it to see the status of your request and ongoing work.

## Support
