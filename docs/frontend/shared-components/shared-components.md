# About

The **shared-components library** is the central place for reusable UI components and a common `joy` theme.  
It is used by **all SAU frontend teams** to ensure a consistent look & feel and to avoid duplicate work.

Before creating a new component in your project, always check if it already exists here.  
If not, you can request a new component so it becomes available for everyone (see [Request a new shared component](./request-shared-component.md)).

# Installation & Usage

For setup and usage examples, see:

- [Frontend template repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/frontend-template)
- [Shared components repository](https://github.com/Agile-Software-Engineering-25/shared-components)

# Support
