# About

The **shared-components library** is the central place for reusable UI components and a common `joy` theme.  
It is used by **all SAU frontend teams** to ensure a consistent look & feel and to avoid duplicate work.

Before creating a new component in your project, always check if it already exists here.  
If not, you can request a new component so it becomes available for everyone (see [Request a new shared component](./request-shared-component.md)).

# ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

All components and the `joy` theme in this repository are currently **examples**.  
They **will be replaced or heavily changed** once real production components are introduced.

# Installation & Usage
