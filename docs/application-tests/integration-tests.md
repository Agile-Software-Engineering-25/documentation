# Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different modules or services of your application interact correctly. When dealing with web applications, this often involves testing user flows that span multiple components or pages. Playwright is an excellent tool for end-to-end and integration testing, and by adopting the Page Object Model (POM), we can write tests that are maintainable, readable, and less prone to breaking.

## What is the Page Object Model (POM)?

The Page Object Model is a design pattern used in test automation frameworks. It treats each web page or significant UI component as a "page object". Each page object encapsulates:

- **Locators:** The strategies to find elements on that page (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).
- **Actions:** The interactions a user can perform on that page (e.g., clicking a button, filling a form).
- **Assertions (optional, but recommended for page-specific state):** Methods to verify the state of elements on that page.

By abstracting page elements and interactions into dedicated objects, our tests become more readable and easier to maintain. If a UI element's locator changes, you only need to update it in one place (the page object), not across all tests that interact with that element.

## Setting Up Your Project

Before writing tests, ensure you have Playwright installed and configured.

1.  **Install Playwright:**

    ```bash
    npm init playwright@latest
    # or
    yarn create playwright
    ```

    Follow the prompts to choose your preferred browser and language (TypeScript is recommended for better type safety).

2.  **Project Structure (Recommended):**

    ```
    your-project/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.spec.ts  // Example: Test suite for authentication
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ product.spec.ts // Example: Test suite for product flows
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ playwright.config.ts // Playwright configuration
    â””â”€â”€ page-objects/
        â”œâ”€â”€ LoginPage.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardPage.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ ProductPage.ts
        â””â”€â”€ BasePage.ts // Optional: For common page functionalities
    ```

## Writing Page Objects

Let's illustrate with a simple login page example.

```typescript
// page-objects/LoginPage.ts
import { Page, expect } from "@playwright/test";

export class LoginPage {
  readonly page: Page;
  readonly usernameInput: string = "#username";
  readonly passwordInput: string = "#password";
  readonly loginButton: string = 'button[type="submit"]';
  readonly errorMessage: string = ".error-message";

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  async navigateTo(): Promise<void> {
    await this.page.goto("/login"); // Assuming base URL is configured
  }

  async login(username: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.page.fill(this.usernameInput, username);
    await this.page.fill(this.passwordInput, password);
    await this.page.click(this.loginButton);
  }

  async getErrorMessage(): Promise<string | null> {
    return await this.page.textContent(this.errorMessage);
  }

  async expectLoggedIn(): Promise<void> {
    // Example: Check for a redirect or element indicating successful login
    await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/);
  }

  async expectLoginFailed(): Promise<void> {
    await expect(this.page.locator(this.errorMessage)).toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

**Key Considerations for Page Objects:**

- **Locators:** Use robust and unique locators (e.g., `data-testid` attributes, CSS selectors for IDs or unique classes). Avoid brittle locators like `nth-child`.
- **Actions:** Methods should represent user interactions (e.g., `login`, `submitForm`, `addItemToCart`).
- **Return Types:** Methods can return `void` for actions that don't change the page context, or another `Page Object` if the action navigates to a new page (e.g., `login` might return a `DashboardPage`).
- **Constructor:** The constructor typically takes a Playwright `Page` object.
- **Encapsulation:** Keep page-specific logic and locators inside the page object.

## Writing Integration Tests

Now, let's write an integration test using our `LoginPage` object.

```typescript
// tests/integration/auth.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { LoginPage } from "../../page-objects/LoginPage";
import { DashboardPage } from "../../page-objects/DashboardPage"; // Assuming you have one

test.describe("Authentication Flows", () => {
  let loginPage: LoginPage;
  let dashboardPage: DashboardPage;

  // Before each test, navigate to the login page and initialize page objects
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(page);
    await loginPage.navigateTo();
  });

  test("should allow a user to log in successfully with valid credentials", async ({
    page,
  }) => {
    await loginPage.login("testuser", "password123");
    await loginPage.expectLoggedIn(); // Using assertion from page object
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toHaveText("Welcome, Test User!"); // Example of additional assertion in test
  });

  test("should prevent login with invalid credentials", async () => {
    await loginPage.login("invaliduser", "wrongpassword");
    await loginPage.expectLoginFailed(); // Using assertion from page object
    const errorMessage = await loginPage.getErrorMessage();
    expect(errorMessage).toContain("Invalid credentials");
  });

  // Example of a multi-page flow test
  test("should log in and navigate to product page", async ({ page }) => {
    await loginPage.login("testuser", "password123");
    await dashboardPage.navigateToProducts(); // Assuming a method in DashboardPage
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/products/);
  });
});
```

**Key Considerations for Integration Tests:**

- **Focus on User Flows:** Integration tests should mimic realistic user interactions that involve multiple parts of your application.
- **Readability:** Tests should be easy to understand by reading the `async` and `await` calls on your page objects.
- **Setup/Teardown:** Use `test.beforeEach` and `test.afterEach` for common setup (e.g., navigating to a starting page, logging in) and cleanup (e.g., logging out, clearing local storage).
- **Data Management:** For integration tests, you might need specific test data. Consider using:
  - **Seeders:** Scripts to populate your database with known data before tests run.
  - **API Calls:** Directly making API calls in `beforeEach` to set up specific test states, bypassing the UI for setup.
- **Assertions:** Assertions should primarily be in your test files, verifying the outcome of a user flow. However, simple, page-specific state assertions can be encapsulated within page objects for convenience (as shown with `expectLoggedIn`).
- **Isolation:** Strive to make each test independent. Avoid tests relying on the state left by a previous test.

## Best Practices and Things to Think About

1.  **Robust Locators:**

    - **Prioritize `data-testid` attributes:** These are ideal as they are specifically for testing and unlikely to change due to styling or text updates.
    - **Use ID's:** If elements have unique IDs, use them.
    - **Descriptive CSS selectors:** For classes, use specific and meaningful class names.
    - **Avoid XPath unless necessary:** XPath can be brittle if the DOM structure changes frequently.
    - **Avoid relying on element text:** Text content can change easily due to i18n or minor content updates.

2.  **Atomic Page Objects:** Keep page objects focused on a single page or significant component. Avoid "God Objects" that try to control too many unrelated parts of the application.

3.  **Naming Conventions:**

    - Page objects: `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`.
    - Methods: `navigateTo`, `login`, `submitForm`, `clickButton`.
    - Locators: `usernameInput`, `loginButton`.

4.  **Handling Asynchronicity:** Playwright is inherently asynchronous. Always use `await` when interacting with Playwright methods and page object methods that perform asynchronous operations.

5.  **Environment Configuration:** Use `playwright.config.ts` to set up your base URL, timeouts, and other environment-specific settings.

    ```typescript
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

    export default defineConfig({
      testDir: "./tests/integration",
      fullyParallel: true,
      forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
      retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
      workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
      reporter: "html",
      use: {
        baseURL: "http://localhost:3000", // Set your application's base URL
        trace: "on-first-retry",
      },
      projects: [
        {
          name: "chromium",
          use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
        },
        // Add other browsers as needed
      ],
    });
    ```

6.  **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate your Playwright tests into your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures tests run automatically on every code change, catching regressions early.

7.  **Error Handling and Debugging:**

    - Use Playwright's built-in tracing and debugging tools (`npx playwright test --debug`).
    - Take screenshots or videos on test failures (`trace: 'on'`) for easier diagnosis.

8.  **Performance:** While integration tests are generally slower than unit tests, optimize them where possible:

    - Avoid unnecessary waits (use Playwright's auto-waiting features).
    - Use API calls for test setup where UI interaction is not strictly necessary for the test case (e.g., creating a user via API instead of UI signup).

9.  **Scope of Integration Tests:**
    - Integration tests are **not** meant to replace unit tests. They focus on how components integrate, not the internal logic of a single component.
    - They are heavier and slower than unit tests, so choose what to test judiciously. Focus on critical user flows and integrations.

By following these guidelines, you can build a robust, maintainable, and effective suite of integration tests for your software development project.
